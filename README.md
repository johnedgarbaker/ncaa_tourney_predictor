#    What the project does: 
This project aims to use metrics used to determine strength of college basketball teams to determine the likelihood
 a team wins games in the NCAA tournament
#    Why the project is useful: 
People love March Madness, and individuals with a rooting interest put time and effort into choosing the right teams. 
While there will always be luck and chance in these games, better predictions can help
#    How users can get started with the project: 
Much of the project is cleaning and tidying code. This project pushes data from the past three years into a common dataframe, 
allowing for more data to analyze. There is the beginning of analysis, but more work to do.
#    Where users can get help with your project: 
Use this data to conduct your own regressions, sampling, and projections. There is more I want to do, but I wanted to get
 this code up before the tournament started.
#    Who maintains and contributes to the project
I do. Please see my contact info if you'd like to see more or use this data.
